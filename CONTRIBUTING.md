# Contributing

<h4>Input and contributions</h4>

- Feel free to add a new issue.
- Discuss the current state of the code
- submit a fix
- propose new features

<h3>Pull Request Process</h3>

- __Use a feature branch__ a pull request should be created from a feature branch and not from *master*.
- __Descriptive commit messages__. 
- __No one-commit-to-rule-them-all__ Large commits that change too many things at the same time are very hard to review. Better to work in smaller focused commits.
- __Tests__ Add relevant tests and make sure all existing ones still pass.
- __No Warnings__ Make sure your code does not produce any build warnings.

<h4>Code and Platform</h4>

- Currently all code is in C# and there will be some in C++ for Arduino programming. Any language is welcome if it has a place and works with the current project.
- Would like to get this running on as many platforms as possible, currently only builds for windows but plan upgrading this to .NET Core in the future.
